interpreter from source for use in other R packages. It exposes only a few
helpers to query the embedded interpreter path and version.

## Installation

``` r
install.packages(
  "CPython",
  repos = c("https://sounkou-bioinfo.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org")
)
```

## Usage

```{r usage}
